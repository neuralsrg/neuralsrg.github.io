In 2024, I graduated from [Moscow State University](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/lomonosov-moscow-state-university), where I studied at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics. I received a Bachelor's degree with Honours in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My thesis explored the [applications of discrete mathematics and combinatorics](https://github.com/neuralsrg/LAD) in machine learning.

During my undergraduate studies, I also worked as a research assistant, applying [deep learning techniques](https://github.com/neuralsrg/EEG/tree/main) to analyze cognitive dynamics and internal speech using human brain EEG data.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree at the same university, with a focus on Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems. Alongside my studies, I work as a Deep Learning Engineer in the RecSys R&D team at Yandex. I'm especially interested in the mathematical theory behind machine learning in general. My Master’s thesis builds on our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09331), which addresses bias correction techniques in large-scale information retrieval systems.

After completing my MSc, I plan to continue in academic research and pursue a PhD. **My research interests** include (but are not limited to) information retrieval, debiasing, conversational and explainable recommender systems, generative models and scaling laws, fairness and inclusion in recommendations, as well as the general underlying mathematics of deep learning (e.g., Bayesian methods).

Outside of academia and work, I’m passionate about chess and travel. I'm always happy to talk about chess tournaments or the places I've explored around the world.
