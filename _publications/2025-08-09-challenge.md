excerpt: 'I am excited to share our work from the RecSys Challenge 2025! In our solution, we combined the Transformer, TwHIN graph neural network, DCN-v2, and hundreds of carefully engineered numeric features. We discuss feature engineering in detail in the Appendix, which one of our reviewers called a "goldmine of practical insights". I presented our paper at RecSys 2025 in Prague.'

This paper describes the 4th-place solution by team ambitious for the RecSys Challenge 2025, organized by Synerise and ACM RecSys, which focused on universal behavioral modeling. The challenge objective was to generate user embeddings effective across six diverse downstream tasks. Our solution integrates (1) a sequential encoder to capture the temporal evolution of user interests, (2) a graph neural network to enhance generalization, (3) a deep cross network to model high-order feature interactions, and (4) performance-critical feature engineering.
